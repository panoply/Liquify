**Default** `[]`

The `liquid.languageParticipants` option allows you to have the extension operate in additional languages. By default, the extension activates in `.liquid`, `.css.liquid`, `.scss.liquid` and `.js.liquid` files but you can extend support to additional languages and each defined language will have the extension features provided (excluding syntax highlighting).
