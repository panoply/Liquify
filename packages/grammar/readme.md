# Grammar

This directory contains the Liquid [TextMate Language Grammars](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars) which are used to provide Liquid syntax highlighting support in text editors which are using the [Liquify](#) extension/package.

### Grammar Variations

There are 3 syntax languages generated, each of which will extend the `default.jsonc` standard Liquid variation grammar.

- [Liquid Standard](#)
- [Liquid Shopify](#)
- [Liquid Jekyll](#)

> If you're a [licensed](#) user of Liquify you can extend grammars to support custom variations of Liquid.
