# @liquify/liquid-linter

Linting capabilties for the Liquid Templating Language that is used by [Liquify IDE](#) text editor plugin.

## Why

Liquid is a basic templating language which often leads to it being expressed by developers in a rather choatic or otherise exhaustive manner. This package will help prevent developers from writting invalid Liquid code and enforce rulesets that help bring some sanity to documents.

## Install

```cli
<pnpm|npm|yarn> i @liquify/liquid-linter --save-dev
```

## Usage

Create a `.liquidrc.json` file and and place it in the root of your project.

```json
{}
```

### AST Nodes

Each node contained on the AST is a class instance. Depending on what type of node (tag) that is parsed some properties may differ, essentially it all boils down to the below:

```ts
```

## Development

The Liquid Parser is written in ES2020 JavaScript using a combination of Babel and BublÃ© for transpilation. Type checking is processed with JSDocs and TypeScript declarations files are leveraged for the more complex structures. Declarations are declared globally and referenced where necessary in jsdoc comment/type params. TypeScript is also leveraged for numeric/string enums.

> TypeScript files are not processed with the TypeScript compiler but instead using Babel and Terser. The `tsconfig.json` located at root exists to provide vscode intellisense features, for bundle configuration, see the `rollup.config.js` file.

## Tests

Tests are provided using [AVA](#) and can be found in the `/test` directory. When running `pnpm dev` and launching development, tests will run along side bundling.
