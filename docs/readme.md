#### Directory Structure

The directory structure . This structure is far more logical and visually pleasing opposed to the standard structure shipped with Jekyll.

```
├── .netlify
├── functions
├── public

   ├── app
   │   ├── components
   │   ├── controllers
   │   └── index.js

```

#### JavaScript

The project implements [Mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org/), [Stimulus.js](https://stimulusjs.org/) and [SPX](https://spx.js.org/). These 3 modules act in unity to provide a static hybrid PWA browsing experience. This odd and otherwise opinionated combination of Open Source tools results in blazing fast renders and instant per page navigation requests.

#### Styling

The project styling leverages the [@brixtol/bootstrap](https://github.com/BRIXTOL/bootstrap) hard fork framework for grid and utilities. Production builds will have the vast majority of the styles purged in the post-build cycle.
