# Liquify

Language tooling for the [Liquid Template Language](#). Liquify provides IDE capabilities to developers working with Liquid and its multiple variations. Contained in this monorepo repository is various packages and modules used by the Liquify text editor extension available in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com).

- [Documentation](https://liquify.dev)
- [VSCode Extension](#)

### Why

The Liquid template language has been around for a long time. Created by Shopify CEO [Tobi L√ºtke](https://twitter.com/tobi) it is leveraged by hundreds of SaaS services and thousands of open source projects. Despite Liquid being actively maintained by Shopify and the foundation for its storefront themes, very little effort on their behalf has been to provide modern IDE features for those developers working within environments using this template language.

Liquify was created to solve this issue and provide everything required for Liquid and Shopify theme projects. It aims to deliver powerful editor capabilities that enrich the programing experience and lives of developers.

### Pricing / License

Liquify is currently free to use in this alpha pre-release stage. A yearly licensing cost may _potentially_ be incurred for those who want features which pertain to the Shopify variation. There are no plans as of yet to implement this pay wall so it exists free to use with all features available to all users.

###### IMPORTANT

**Packages may operating under [MIT](https://mit-license.org/), [PROPRIETARY](#) or [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](#). Those which are operating under [PROPRIETARY](#) consider source code as [Trade Secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software#Types). Though code is public, please be aware of the licensing imposed upon each package.**

### Client Packages

These packages are the text editor [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/) clients.

- [@liquify/vscode](#)

### Core Packages

These packages are considered the _core_ modules of the project.

- [@liquify/liquid-parser](#)
- [@liquify/liquid-language-server](#)
- [@liquify/liquid-language-specs](#)
- [@liquify/prettify](#)
- [@liquify/schema-specs](#)
- [@liquify/syncify](#)

### Utility Packages

These packages are mostly project specific [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) plugins.

- [@liquify/cryptographer](#)
- [@liquify/rollup-cryptospec](#)
- [@liquify/rollup-obfuscator](#)
- [@liquify/rollup-enums](#)
- [@liquify/rollup-utils](#)
- [@liquify/rollup-watch](#)

### Config Packages

These packages are the sharable configurations for the development workspace.

- [@liquify/eslint-config](#)
- [@liquify/prettier-config](#)
- [@liquify/rollup-config](#)
- [@liquify/tsconfig](#)

## Contributing

The project is a monorepo that uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) for dependency and workspace management. Development is intended to be conducted within the [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor.

<details>
<summary>
  Pre-requisites
</summary>
<p>

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node v14^](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Pnpm v5^](https://pnpm.js.org/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

</p>
</details>

### Installation

- Ensure [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) is installed globally `npm i pnpm -g`
- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/panoply/liquify.git`
- Run `pnpm i`

The project will be complied and all packages will build in `postinstall. You can `cd`into any package or alternatively you can run `pnpm dev`from workspace root to execute a global watch. It is recommended to`cd` into the packages and conduct development from within the specific directories and leverage Terminal panes because this way you get better oversight.

### Developing

All packages are compiled with [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and are processed together with the [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) bundler. Each package contains a `rollup.config.mjs` file. Each contained package follows a standardized script execution pattern:

#### Per Package

```
pnpm dev       Watch and build mode
pnpm build     Build mode only (production)
pnpm test      Run tests, the project uses AVA
```

If you cannot be bothered to `cd` into each package then you can target packages from root directory of the workspace by passing the target name prepended with an `@` character or alternatively just run `pnpm dev` and all core packages will run in watch mode.

#### Recursive (Workspace Root)

```
pnpm dev                    Watch input files/directories and rebuild on changes
pnpm build                  Build production/development bundles
pnpm build:utils            Build development bundles only, ie: utilities
pnpm build:all              Build production/development bundles, runs on postinstall
```

#### Targeting (Workspace Root)

```
pnpm @server                <dev|build|test>   Targets the Liquid Language Server package
pnpm @prettify              <dev|build|test>   Targets the Prettify package
pnpm @parser                <dev|build|test>   Targets the Liquid Language Parser package
pnpm @specs                 <dev|build|test>   Targets the Liquid Language Specs package
pnpm @schema                <dev|build|test>   Targets the Schema Stores package
pnpm @vscode                <dev|build>        Targets the vscode client package
```

#### Utilities (Workspace Root)

```
pnpm @rollup-config         <dev|build>        Targets the rollup config package
pnpm @rollup-plugins        <dev|build>        Targets the rollup plugins package
pnpm @rollup-enums          <dev|build>        Targets the rollup enums plugin package
pnpm @rollup-obfuscator     <dev|build>        Targets the rollup obfuscator plugin package
pnpm @rollup-watch          <dev|build>        Targets the rollup watch plugin package
pnpm @rollup-cryptospec     <dev|build>        Targets the rollup cryptospec plugin package
pnpm @rollup-utils          <dev|build>        Targets the rollup utilities package

## Acknowledgements

Liquify took a considerable amount of time to build. Many sleepless nights and a lot of hours were poured into the project as not many were willing to take on this task. Thanks to all those who used the previous version of this extension and a special thanks to a couple of developers who were key players in the overall approaches.
