# Rollup Plugins

Liquify leverages the [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) module bundler for transpilation. Packages within the Liquify project use these plugins to assist development process.

### Reasoning

The Rollup [plugin](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#plugin-development) API provides a efficient way to hook into the transpilation process when generating distributed bundles. Developing a Rollup plugin is rather simple and prevents the need of having to rely upon additional tooling.

### Plugins

#### [@liquify/rollup-plugin-utils](https://github.com/panoply/liquify/tree/next/build/rollup-plugins/utils)

Various project specific rollup plugin utilities that are commonly used modules across the [Liquify](https://github.com/panoply/liquify) monorepo and included within package `rollup.config.js` files contained in the workspace.
