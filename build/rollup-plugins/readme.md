# Rollup Plugins

Liquify leverages the [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) module bundler across its workspace and almost all the containing packages use Rollup for transpilation. Packages within the Liquify project use these plugins to assist development process. The plugins are available on the public NPM registry for consumption and in addition can be appropriated outside the project.

### Why?

The [plugin](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#plugin-development) API provides a efficient way to hook into transpilation processes when generating distributed bundles. Developing a Rollup plugin is rather simple and prevents the need of having to rely upon additional tooling in development resulting in a centralized workflow.

### Plugins

#### [@liquify/rollup-plugin-cryptospec](https://github.com/panoply/liquify/tree/next/build/rollup-plugins/cryptospec)

Facilitates encryption using [aes-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) algorithms. Transforms objects, strings and numbers. The cryptospec plugin transforms the propreitary specifications into enigmatic strings exports.

#### [@liquify/rollup-plugin-globs](https://github.com/panoply/liquify/tree/next/build/rollup-plugins/globs)

Provides watch, copy, transform, re-path and rename capabilities for files in a development workspace. The plugin is essentially a stripped down and hard-fork extended version of [rollup-plugin-globsync](https://github.com/tivac/).

#### [@liquify/rollup-plugin-obfuscator](https://github.com/panoply/liquify/tree/next/build/rollup-plugins/obfuscator)

Implements [JavaScript Obfuscator](https://github.com/javascript-obfuscator/javascript-obfuscator) and facilitates in obfuscation. This is a hard-fork of the current[rollup-plugin-javascript-obfuscator](https://github.com/javascript-obfuscator/) plugin which is using a deprecated API.

#### [@liquify/rollup-plugin-utils](https://github.com/panoply/liquify/tree/next/build/rollup-plugins/utils)

Various project specific rollup plugin utilities that are commonly used modules across the [Liquify](https://github.com/panoply/liquify) monorepo and included within package `rollup.config.js` files contained in the workspace.

### Usage

Plugins are installed as a development dependencies via `pnpm i` in packages.
